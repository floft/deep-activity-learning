# Deep Activity Learning (DAL)

Goals:

 - Compare random forest activity learning (AL) with deep activity learning
 - Compare previous AL features with simpler feature vector
 - Add domain adaptation and generalization to deep network for further
   improvement

Steps:

  - Preprocess data extracting the desired features (see *preprocessing/*)
  - Create cross validation datasets (see *datasets/*)
  - Run and compare AL (*al.py*) and DAL (*dal.py*) on the datasets
